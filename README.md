  **Welcome to WorkVibes!** 🎉

WorkVibes is a social network designed to foster collaboration and connection among members of a company. It is developed using React and Node.js with Express, along with other libraries to enhance functionality and user experience.

🌟 **Technologies Used:**

**Backend**

***Node.js:*** Our backend is developed with Node.js, providing a solid and scalable foundation to handle server operations.

**Express:** We use Express, a Node.js web framework, to simplify the development process and create robust and efficient APIs.

**Mongoose:** With Mongoose, seamlessly interact with your MongoDB database, allowing for simple and flexible data management.

**bcrypt:** To ensure account security, we use bcrypt for password encryption during registration.

**jsonwebtoken:** For authentication, we generate and verify tokens with jsonwebtoken, ensuring secure access to WorkVibes features.

**multer:** To handle file uploads, such as profile photos, we use multer, providing a simple and efficient solution for server-side file management.

**express-validator:** With express-validator, we easily validate emails and passwords during registration, ensuring the reliability of user data.


**Frontend**

**React:** Our frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**Redux:** We use Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, to manage application state across components.
